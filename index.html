            <p>When creating a website, developers have to make their client's vision a reality. They build particular
                types of websites, such as ecommerce, news, or gaming sites, to fit clients' needs. Different types of
                websites require different applications. For example, a gaming site should be able to handle advanced
                graphics, whereas an ecommerce site would need a payment-processing application. The developer decides
                which applications and designs will best fit the site..</p>
